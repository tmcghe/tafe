## Assessment Task 1: Network Setup, Testing, Troubleshooting, and Verification ##
You are required to perform a series of parts using physical equipment. These parts are designed to set up a complex network based on a given case study. Your skills and knowledge required for technical specifications, and practical configurations in ICTNWK529 will be assessed.
Every part is supposed to be done weekly, but the schedule may be altered depending on your skill set and instructor’s teaching plan. Additionally, these parts are designed to be completed in order, meaning that parts are not to be selected randomly as prior parts prepare you for the next one. This implies that you need to save the physical devices’ configurations when one part is finished, which will prepare you for the next part scheduled in the following week. Respectively, when the next lesson begins in the following week, it is expected of you to start where you left off and complete that week’s part; you can quickly setup the lab environment as described for that specific week.
Furthermore, it is required of you to take screenshots* of your successful lab results (according to your teacher’s instructions) and attach them to your portfolio so it can be marked on LMS. These screenshots are evidence that the part has been successfully completed.
*The screenshots that are to be taken will be decided by your instructor.
