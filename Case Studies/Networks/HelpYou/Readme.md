Project that encapsulates the two subjects:
ICTNWK529 Install and manage complex ICT networks
ICTNWK546 Manage network security

For building HelpYou IT from the ground up with advanced networking protocols and standards using cisco 1941 routers and 2940 switches hardware.

Complementary cisco packet tracer files (.pkt) files are provided to showcase on vIOS.

To pass the network needed to be ran on real hardware and marked off by a teacher, which was completed successfully.

To pass the software side, all programs and software needed to be able to be successfully deployed (i.e the same as a real world env), which was successfully completed.
